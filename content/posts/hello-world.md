Welcome to my Industrial Data Acquisition Blog.  
Here I share tutorials and insights on building low-cost, scalable industrial data acquisition and visualization systems using Hugo and PaperMod.

## Topics Covered

- Industrial sensor selection  
- Data acquisition protocols (RS485, Modbus, TCP/IP, USB, etc.)  
- Real-time monitoring dashboards  
- Automated reporting and alerts  
- Low-cost scalable solutions  

This blog aims to help engineers and enthusiasts quickly set up reliable industrial data collection systems, visualize data on the web, and implement basic AI or automation features.

Stay tuned for more posts and updates!
